## 🧠 Description

The core content is a detailed mind map of hybrid attack and defense strategies within Microsoft Entra environments (formerly Azure AD). It serves as an educational and planning resource for:

- Security professionals designing layered defenses
- Threat analysts modeling attack surfaces
- Red and Blue teams for training or simulation

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **View Artifacts:**  
   Open any file in the `artifacts/` folder to see the full or collapsed mind map in PDF or PNG format.

2. **Edit Source Maps:**  
   Open the `.mm` or `.smmx` files in compatible mind mapping tools:
   - `.mm`: FreeMind (open-source)
   - `.smmx`: SimpleMind

## 📦 Tools Used

- **FreeMind** or **SimpleMind** for mind map creation and editing
- Exported visualizations generated within the mind mapping tools
